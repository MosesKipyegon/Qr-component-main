### Built with

### What I learned

Learnt to work around media queries howver my design breaks when I have the two designs together which is mobile view and desktop

And how to throw the design in the middle. using the following code


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I definitely have to work around media queries as this is still a big challenge for me
